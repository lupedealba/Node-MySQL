. This time, though, you need to include screenshots or a video showing us that you got the app working with no bugs. You can include these screenshots or a link to a video in a README.md file.


Include screenshots (or a video) of typical user flows through your application (for the customer and if relevant the manager/supervisor). This includes views of the prompts and the responses after their selection (for the different selection options).
Include any other screenshots you deem necessary to help someone who has never been introduced to your application understand the purpose and function of it. This is how you will communicate to potential employers/other developers in the future what you built and why, and to show how it works. 
Because screenshots (and well-written READMEs) are extremely important in the context of GitHub, this will be part of the grading.

# Node-MySQL

**What is it:**
Homework #12:
In this activity, I created an Amazon-like storefront with the MySQL. The app takes in orders from customers and depletes stock from the store's inventory. So after launching node.js The app will list the items available for purchase. Once the customer chooses what item to purchase it will ask what quantity do the want to buy. If the customer wants to buy more then what is in stock, the app wil notify them to choose something else to buy or to buy less. After the purchase is done, the app will list the total amount payed and the new stock quantity for that item. Below is a video of how the app works. The screenshot shows the result after the item is purchased.
